# Lifecycle Functions
## OnStart
Called before the component's first frame update (i.e. at the start of the game or as soon as the component has been created)
OnStarts are processed at the beginning of every frame, before any other lifecycle functions are processed.
```lua
OnStart = function(self)
	self.rb = self:GetComponent("Rigidbody")
end
```
## OnUpdate
Called every frame.
:::{note}
Actor updates are processed **in the order that they are created**, and the actor's components are processed **alphabetically by component key**.
:::
```lua
OnUpdate = function(self)
	if self.rb:GetPosition().x >= 100
		Debug.Log("You win the race!")
		Application.Quit()
	end
end
```
## OnLateUpdate
## OnDestroy
