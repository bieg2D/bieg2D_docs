# Input Update
- Checks input state and collects any SDL events
- Updates state of keys 
# Load Scene
- If a scene load has been requested, the engine will load it now (before updating any actors in the old scene)
# Actors Update
:::{note}
Actors are updated in the order that they are created (top to bottom in scenes). Components within actors are updated alphabetically by key.
:::
## Actor Start
## Actor Update
## Actor LateUpdate
## Process Add and Remove Actors
:::{warning}
Note that actor removals ( Destroy() ) are processed __after__ additions.
This means that if an actor is added and removed in a frame, it **will not** be added to the scene and exist in the next frame. (Although this shouldn't be possible, since Destroy() requires a reference, if you find a way to add, remove, then add the same actor know that it won't persist.)
:::
### Process Add Actor Requests
- Add any actors that were Instantiated this frame to the scene
### Process Remove Actor Requests
# Event Bus Update
# Advance Physics Step
# Render
- Processes all draw calls made throughout the frame, and renders them to the frame buffer
## Update Scale
- If the render scale has changed during the frame, the engine will process that before any draw calls have been rendered.
## Render DrawImage()
## Render DrawUI()
## Render DrawText()
## Render DrawPixel()
# Input LateUpdate
- End-of-frame updates for key input states
- Removes "this frame" states
- GetKeyDown -> GetKey
- GetKeyUp -> nothing
# Draw Frame Buffer
- Draws the frame buffer to the screen
