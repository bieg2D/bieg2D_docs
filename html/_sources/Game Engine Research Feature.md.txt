Task Progress
- [x] Reading Animation File Format
- [x] Basic C++ Animator Component (can cycle images)
- [x] Variable Framerate Support
- [x] Play Animation (Interrupt current animation)
- [x] Default Animation (looping animation that plays when nothing else is playing)
- [x] Callbacks using EventBus (on animation finished)
- [ ] Ability to queue animation to start on next animation frame (to keep framerate consistent)
- [x] Bugfixing
- [x] Developer Experience Enhancement (functions like GetFPS and GetDefaultAnimation to check values in Lua, customized pivot point per animation)
- [x] (Stretch Goal) Hold frame support
- [ ] (Stretch Goal) C++ Animation Renderer Component (decided not to do)
